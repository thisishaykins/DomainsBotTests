## Test Questions
1. Write a function that tells you whether a word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or a phrase that is the same whether you read it backwards or forwards, for example the word ‘refer’. On the other hand, ‘refers’ is not a palindrome.
2. Write a function which, given a string, finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
